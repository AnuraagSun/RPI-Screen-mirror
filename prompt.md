**üìå Objective:**
Build a complete cross-platform Python desktop application that **displays the live desktop screen of a Raspberry Pi 4** on a Windows/Linux PC via a **USB-A to USB-A cable**, without using HDMI capture, VNC, or network-based protocols.

---

### üíª System Overview:

**Architecture:**

1. **Raspberry Pi 4:**

   * Acts as a **USB gadget device**.
   * Captures live screen content using Python.
   * Compresses frames (e.g., JPEG).
   * Sends them over USB (via virtual serial port `/dev/ttyGS0`).

2. **PC Application (Python GUI):**

   * Written using **PyQt5** (or optionally Tkinter or Pygame).
   * Reads serial data from the USB port.
   * Decodes incoming image frames.
   * Displays them in a resizable GUI window.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Features to Implement:

#### On Raspberry Pi Side:

* Set up **USB gadget mode** using `dwc2` and `g_serial`.
* Capture screen frames using `mss`, `scrot`, or raw `/dev/fb0`.
* Compress each frame as JPEG to reduce data size.
* Send the JPEG bytes over `/dev/ttyGS0`, prefixed with the length (4 bytes, big-endian).
* Send at around 10‚Äì20 FPS (use `time.sleep()` to throttle).

#### On PC Side:

* Create a GUI in **PyQt5**.
* Open serial port (`COMx` on Windows, `/dev/ttyUSBx` on Linux).
* Read the 4-byte frame length, then receive the full JPEG frame.
* Decode JPEG using OpenCV or Pillow.
* Display frame in real-time using QLabel or canvas widget.
* Add a resize handler to keep frame aspect ratio.
* Optional: Display current FPS and connection status.

---

### üîå USB Gadget Setup (on RPi):

* Modify `/boot/config.txt` to enable:

  ```ini
  dtoverlay=dwc2
  ```
* Modify `/boot/cmdline.txt` to include:

  ```txt
  rootwait modules-load=dwc2,g_serial
  ```
* Reboot to expose a virtual serial device (`/dev/ttyGS0`).
* On the PC side, this will appear as a COM port or `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters:

* **Compression:** JPEG (`quality=50‚Äì70`).
* **Frame size:** Fullscreen or scaled (e.g., 720p).
* **Baud Rate (if needed):** 115200 or higher (raw USB transfer, not actual UART).
* **Refresh Rate:** 10‚Äì20 FPS.

---

### üöÄ Deliverables (Expected Output):

1. Python script for Raspberry Pi:

   * Efficient screen capture and USB JPEG streaming via `/dev/ttyGS0`.

2. Python desktop app for PC:

   * GUI with real-time frame rendering.
   * Handles serial read and JPEG decoding.
   * Optional: Save snapshot or record stream.

3. (Optional Bonus):

   * Tkinter or Pygame version.
   * Option to toggle grayscale or resolution.
   * Status bar with FPS and dropped frame count.

---

### ‚úÖ Constraints:

* Must **not use HDMI capture**, VNC, or TCP/IP network.
* Must use **USB-A to USB-A** connection only.
* Target platforms: Raspberry Pi OS (Lite or Full), Windows 10/11, Linux Ubuntu.

---

### üôã Prompt Goals:

* Provide **working Python code** for both sender (RPi) and receiver (PC).

* Include comments to explain:

  * USB gadget setup.
  * Frame encoding.
  * Serial streaming logic.
  * GUI rendering loop.

* Use only standard libraries and common Python packages (`PySerial`, `OpenCV`, `mss`, `PyQt5`, etc.).

* Make it runnable without Docker or external servers.

---
basically :
  1. "Write the Raspberry Pi script that captures screen and streams JPEG frames over `/dev/ttyGS0` via serial."
  2. "Now write a PyQt5 app that receives JPEG frames over serial and displays them in a GUI window."
